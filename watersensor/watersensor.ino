//
// WATER SENSOR
// Based on lab 7
// NOTE: Digital write and pin mode functions were just used for ease of testing the threshold. IT WILL NOT BE KEPT IN THE FINAL VERSION.
// Water sensor uses analog pin 0, while the LED is currently set to digital 7 and 2. 
//
// NOTE: Disconnect the water sensor while you're not testing it to help prevent corrosion
// NOTE: This is not set to link to a main driver. I can edit it to do that later on if we make a main driver.
// NOTE: The exact water level tends to be a bit scuffed immediately after removing it from water it should even out eventually.
